KSF Media (now a part of Bonnier News) used to have its own
development team.  We had the idea to start a tech blog, like what the
cool kids have.  That never came to pass but we (well, just me really)
prepared a number of articles for it.

These articles cover topics about some concepts in Haskell and web
development with PureScript.  One about GCP, too.  They may be a bit
raw and if we had published them we would likely have done a round of
edits on them.

We're publishing them now before the last guys to leave turn off the
lights.
